## v14 - May 1 2024

* Port to Plasma 6 and rebase main script on latest upstream showdesktop widget by @David-JonesDVN (Pull Request #24)
* Detect openSUSE and replace `qdbus` in commands with `qdbus6` (Issue #25)
* Indicate if widgets are currently locked since we can lock widgets within QML instead of `qdbus` commands in Plasma 6.

## v13 - August 16 2023

* Change default size from `3px` to `8px` (Issue #20)
* Workaround the Plasma Exectuable DataEngine's "rate limiting" where a command can only run one at a time. Wheel to control volume should be better as it no longer waits for the previous `qdbus` command to finish.
* Add a couple fr/ar translations from KDE. Update i18n scripts.

## v12 - December 19 2021

* Support Plasma 5.21's margins by setting `plasmoid.constraintHints` = `PlasmaCore.Types.CanFillArea` to fill up to the edges of the panel.

* Remove (Plasma 5.18) text from "Toggle Lock Widgets" in context menu.
* Generate a `metadata.json`

## v11 - April 14 2020

* Add Dutch translations by @Vistaus (Pull Request #6)

## v8 - October 19 2019

* Only show a edge line on the left on a horizontal panel, or the top of the button on a vertical panel.
* Use the desktop theme textColor instead of the buttonBackgroundColor for the edge color.
* 3 colors are now configurable. The edge line color, the hovered color, and the pressed color.
* Enlargen the widget and show a move icon when widgets are unlocked so that it's easier to move or remove the widget.
* Add Spanish translations by @wuniversales (Issue #4)
