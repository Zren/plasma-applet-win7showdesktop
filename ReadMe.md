# Show Desktop (Win7)

* Plasma 6: https://store.kde.org/p/2151247/

A fork of [the default plasmoid](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop/tree/master/applets/showdesktop) but removes the icon and looks like a flat thin button. Can be configured to minimize all windows instead of "peaking" at the desktop, or to run a command. Scrolling over the button changes the volume, switch desktop, or any other command.

## B) Install via GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applets.git
cd plasma-applets/org.kde.plasma.win7showdesktop
